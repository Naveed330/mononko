            A collection of 5,000 unique HAKIs built to go beyond the digital
            space that will unlock numerous benefits for our community, starting
            with our streetwear, NFT airdrops, live events, holders utility and
            much more as we progress through our journey! With HAKI, our goal is
            to build an organic community that will bring focus on most
            decisions for the project to shape and drive the project going
            forward. We plan to set goals that go beyond the NFT space and to
            set a top standard for the anime community.
